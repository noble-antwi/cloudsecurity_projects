# Google Cloud Cybersecurity Certificate Program Projects

Welcome to my repository dedicated to the projects completed during the Google Cloud Cybersecurity Certificate Program. This collection showcases the hands-on experiences and practical skills I gained throughout the course, designed to equip professionals with the knowledge and tools to secure cloud environments effectively.

## About the Course

The Google Cloud Cybersecurity Certificate Program is a comprehensive course that covers essential cybersecurity concepts, tools, and best practices specific to Google Cloud. The program aims to develop a solid foundation in cybersecurity principles while focusing on real-world applications in cloud environments. Key topics include:

- **Cybersecurity Fundamentals**: Understanding the core principles of cybersecurity, including threat modeling, risk management, and security controls.
  - **Google Cloud Security Tools**: Hands-on experience with tools such as:
  - **Cloud Armor**: Provides DDoS protection and web application firewall capabilities to safeguard applications.
  - **Cloud Identity**: Enables secure user and group management, authentication, and access control across Google Cloud resources.
  - **Security Command Center**: Offers visibility and control over security posture, helping to identify vulnerabilities and threats across Google Cloud services.
  - **Cloud Security Scanner**: Automates security assessments for web applications hosted on Google Cloud, identifying vulnerabilities like cross-site scripting and outdated libraries.
  - **Google Cloud Logging and Monitoring**: Integrates logging and monitoring capabilities to track events and performance metrics for security and compliance.
  - **VPC Service Controls**: Enhances the security of Google Cloud resources by establishing service perimeters to mitigate data exfiltration risks.
  - **BigQuery Data Loss Prevention (DLP)**: Helps discover, classify, and protect sensitive data stored in BigQuery datasets.
  - **IAM (Identity and Access Management)**: Manages access control policies, ensuring users have the appropriate permissions to interact with resources.
  - **Cloud Key Management Service (KMS)**: Provides centralized management of cryptographic keys for your cloud services, enhancing data security.
  -  **Chronicle**: A security analytics platform that provides threat detection, investigation, and response capabilities, allowing organizations to analyze and respond to security events across their infrastructure effectively

- **Incident Response**: Learning how to prepare for, detect, and respond to security incidents effectively.
- **Compliance and Governance**: Understanding the regulatory frameworks and governance models essential for maintaining security and compliance in cloud infrastructures.
