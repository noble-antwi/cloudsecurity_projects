# Cymbal Retail Capstone Project Documentation

## 1. Introduction

Welcome to my capstone project documentation for the Google Cloud Cybersecurity Certificate Program. This project represents a culmination of my learning and hands-on experience in cloud cybersecurity, focusing on the practical application of the skills acquired throughout the course.

As organizations increasingly rely on digital platforms, the importance of robust cybersecurity measures cannot be overstated. The capstone project provides an invaluable opportunity to simulate real-world scenarios that cybersecurity professionals face daily. In this project, I assume the role of a junior cloud security analyst at Cymbal Retail, a prominent retail giant with a substantial global presence. The objective is to navigate the complexities of a data breach incident, employing systematic approaches to identify vulnerabilities, contain the breach, recover affected systems, verify compliance, and remediate any outstanding issues.

Through this documentation, I aim to not only demonstrate my technical competencies but also to share insights and lessons learned during the project. By contributing this project to my GitHub portfolio, I hope to showcase my ability to tackle cybersecurity challenges in a structured and effective manner, making me a strong candidate for future opportunities in the field.

## 2. Project Scenario

### Overview of Cymbal Retail

Cymbal Retail is a leading retail corporation operating 170 physical stores and an online platform across 28 countries. With reported revenues of $15 billion in 2022 and a workforce of 80,400 employees, the company has established itself as a key player in the global retail market. However, with this growth comes the increasing responsibility to safeguard sensitive customer data and protect against evolving cyber threats.

### The Data Breach Incident

Recently, Cymbal Retail experienced a significant data breach that compromised sensitive customer information and internal systems. This incident not only jeopardizes the company’s reputation but also poses potential financial risks and legal implications. As a junior member of the security team, my role is crucial in supporting the response efforts throughout the lifecycle of this security incident.

### Incident Response Objectives

In addressing the data breach, my primary objectives include:

1. **Identifying Vulnerabilities**: Conduct a thorough analysis to pinpoint the vulnerabilities that contributed to the breach, utilizing various security assessment tools and methodologies.

2. **Isolation and Containment**: Implement immediate measures to isolate the compromised systems and contain the breach, preventing further unauthorized access to sensitive data.

3. **System Recovery**: Collaborate with the security team to recover compromised systems, ensuring the integrity and security of restored operations.

4. **Compliance Verification**: Verify compliance with relevant frameworks and standards, assessing the effectiveness of existing security measures and identifying gaps that need to be addressed.

5. **Remediation of Compliance Issues**: Address any outstanding compliance-related issues to reinforce the company’s security posture and minimize future risks.

By systematically addressing these objectives, I aim to contribute meaningfully to Cymbal Retail’s incident response efforts, fostering a culture of security awareness and resilience within the organization.
